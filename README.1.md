## Header


In this challenge, you build a application. _Modern Day Researcher_ are all the rage these days. Currently the application is trying to receive some `Links`, however we are currently locked out.

Implement an User Authentication System in order to access the links from the Links API that we want to consume. My system uses `bcrypt` for hashing and encrypting your user's passwords, as well as JWT for handling the authorization aspect of the app.
